Description: The R453Plus1 Toolbox comprises useful functions for the
        analysis of data generated by Roche's 454 sequencing platform.
        It adds functions for quality assurance as well as for
        annotation and visualization of detected variants,
        complementing the software tools shipped by Roche with their
        product. Further, a pipeline for the detection of structural
        variants is provided.
